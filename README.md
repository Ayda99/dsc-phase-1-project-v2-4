# Conclusion

As per the data exploring, We were able to observe what reasonable measure to account for in determining a succesful movie is a combination of different factors.From all the analysis made so far,I would suggest the company to have a marketing team that uses strategy to advertise movies worldwide to gain increased profit. I would suggest for the company to decide what approach they would choose in deciding movie genre; if they want to compete with other industries focus on producing Documentray/Drama but if the focus is to earn income focus on Fantasy/Romance. I would suggest the comapny aims to have thier movie runtime be between 75-100minutes for possible high rating. and finally i would suggest the company to higher a producer with a lot of experience in the movie industry such as Tony Newton who has produced more than 200 movies.
