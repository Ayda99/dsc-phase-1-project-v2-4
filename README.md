# Conclusion

As per the data exploring, We were able to observe what reasonable measure to account for in determining a succesful movie is a combination of different factors.From all the observations made, I have suggested that Microsoft's new movie studio focuses on genre that is making the most profit. By choosing this Microsoft's new movie studio would be able to set thier budget, target thier audience and estimate how much profit they could obtain.
